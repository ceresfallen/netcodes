# Changelog

For The Geek Code, in reverse chronological order

## 4.1.0 ##

10 Jan 2021

* In order to consolidate parts of the Bear code into this as a base, several things were changed for compliance's sake.

  * Identifiers now have a more rigid format and definition.
  
  * Quantifiers can now be run length compressed.
  
* Changes
  
  * a : wetware - age - expansion, given the expanded space from changing quantifiers.
  
  * b : Wetware - beards - expansion and definition stolen from the Bear Code
  
  * d - Wetware - dimensions - split into width and height, and defined centered-ish on the averages worldwide.
  
  * G : Github Handle - there are better ways to list this, and due to multiple complaints about the format of signatures and duplicated data in general, I feel like your social should be separate from your geek code. In this opinionated way, I've struck `G` from the record.
  
  * L: Programming languages - changed to lP
    
    * changed C#'s identifer - from `LC#` to `lPcsh` (new category, restrictions, and somewhat consistent with pygments lexer shortname)
    
    * probably changed and/or removed quite a number if we're being real here. And I don't really care much.
    
  * PGP: Pretty Good Privacy - removed - it's common to include your PGP key in a signature, so at that point your opinion (or lack thereof) is pretty apparent. I feel like this should generally be considered both self-evident and separate from the Geek Code. For that reason, it's been struck.

* Eventually, so much was changed I just sort of lost track, and may have missed some thigns I changed. I've completely reorganized and overhauled this. Descriptions are largely recycled, but the structure is different, and the organization.
