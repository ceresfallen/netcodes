Vore is a fetish around consumption or - perhaps more accurately - envelopment of another being. Because I have this fetish, I'd like to clean up and restandardize the old Vore Code. I haven't even begun on it, however.

I am aware that at Eka's exists a "Vore Code 3.0" encoder/decoder. Some analysis shows that they:

* Basically went their own way with it, completely disregarding traditional formats from the Geek Codes

* Clearly built their own thing, which likely either became or was derived from their site sliders for roleplay profiles

I felt it was probably best to rewind time and try to get something sort of derived from the common sliders over there but based on the older vore code. I'll try to note the parts that were inspired and/or caused by ETA's sliders as I get to it.

For now this is just a placeholder.
